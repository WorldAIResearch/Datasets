# Fault Detection Dataset

## IoT

## Network
### hCRF-light
> Our test dataset contained 9 samples in total, equally divided into three classes. We can see that the trained model correctly predicted all 9 samples

## UAV
### ALFA: A Dataset for UAV Fault and Anomaly Detection
>  Currently, the dataset includes processed data for 47 autonomous flights with scenarios for eight different types of control surface (actuator and engine) faults, with a total of 66 minutes of flight in normal conditions and 13 minutes of post-fault flight time

## Sensor
### Benchmark Datasets for Fault Detection and Classification in Sensor Data
> We prepare and publish three such benchmark datasets, together with the algorithmic methods used to create
them: a dataset of 280 temperature and light subsets of data from 10 indoor Intel Lab sensors, a dataset of
140 subsets of outdoor temperature data from SensorScope sensors, and a dataset of 224 subsets of outdoor
temperature data from 16 Smart Santander sensors.
